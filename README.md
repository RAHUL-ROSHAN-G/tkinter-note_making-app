# tkinter-note_making-app

Hi I am Rahul Roshan G find some mindblowing code here. Here first you press "register button" and type the username and password. Now login through same credentials. 
Now create a new notes with first blank for file name and second for the text that should be. Then view notes and enter the text file name displayed above. Then delete notes same way.

Happy coding.
